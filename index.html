        <h2 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">2. GOA</h2>
        <p>Lying on the western coast, Goa is India's smallest state and unlike any other, known for its endless
            beaches, stellar nightlife, eclectic seafood, world-heritage listed architecture. Spread across just 3,702
            km, Goa lies in the Konkan region. It is a far cry from the hippie haven or a beach getaway, and one of the
            only few destinations that is open 24x7. The laid-backness (susegad) of Goa attracts as many international
            tourists as it does Indians, or even more so.The state of Goa, in India, is famous for its beaches and
            places of worship. Tourism is its primary industry, and is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa,
            with decreased tourist activity inland. Major tourist attractions include Bom Jesus Basilica, Fort Aguada, a
            wax museum on Indian culture, and a heritage museum. The Churches and Convents of Goa have been declared a
            World Heritage Site by UNESCO.</p>

        <h2 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">3. VARANASI</h2>
        <p>Varanasi, or Benaras, (also known as Kashi) is one of the oldest living cities in the world. Varanasi`s
            Prominence in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. Mark Twain, the English author and literature, who
            was enthralled by the legend and sanctity of Benaras, once wrote : “Benaras is older than history, older
            than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old as all of them put together. ”The land of
            Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for Hindus for ages. Hindus believe that one who is
            graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and
            re-birth. Abode of Lord Shiva and Parvati, the origins of Varanasi are yet unknown. Ganges in Varanasi is
            believed to have the power to wash away the sins of mortals.</p>

            tourists. Rajasthan attracts tourists for its historical forts, palaces, art and culture with its slogan
            "Padharo mhare desh'. Every third foreign tourist visiting India travels to Rajasthan as it is part of the
            Golden Triangle for tourists visiting India.The palaces of Jaipur, lakes of Udaipur, and desert forts of
            Jodhpur, Bikaner, and Jaisalmer are among the most preferred destinations of many tourists, Indian and
            foreign. Tourism accounts for eight percent of the state's domestic product.Many old and neglected palaces
            and forts have been converted into heritage hotels.It is the most beautiful place in India with heritage of
